👋 Hi there, I’m Trần Hoàng Long (trhlow)

🎮 Unity / Game Developer (Intern–Fresher level)
📚 Information Technology student — focusing on Game Development & C#

I enjoy building small-to-medium Unity projects to practice gameplay logic, player control, collision handling, and clean code structure.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Game Engine: Unity (2D)

Language: C#

Game Concepts:

Game loop

Grid-based movement

Collision & physics (2D)

State management (Playing / Game Over / Restart)

Tools: Git, GitHub, Unity Hub

Graphics: Basic 2D, ShaderLab / HLSL (fundamental usage)

🚀 Featured Projects
🐍 Snake Game (Unity / C#)

👉 https://github.com/trhlow/CSN-TranHoangLong-110123025-SnakeGame

A classic Snake Game built with Unity, focusing on:

Grid-based movement

Player input handling

Collision detection (wall & self)

Score system and game state management
➡️ Used as academic project & portfolio piece.

A small interactive web project with animations and storytelling, built to practice front-end logic and UI interaction.

📌 What I’m Learning Now

Better Unity architecture (separating gameplay, UI, managers)

Writing cleaner & more maintainable C# scripts

Preparing projects for internship-level production quality
